	<p><h3>Our Company has been in existence for nearly 3 years now. Our Founder and CEO is Monteria Holmes. When younger, she admired nail care and began practicing with nail polish, upgrading to acrylic at age 15. At the age of 16 she was well trained enough to begin to teach others the art of acrylic and sculpting. Monteria has mastered the stiletto and coffin shape.</h3></p>

	<p><h3>In 2011 Monteria attended Paul Mitchell cosmetology school where she earned her certificate in nails. She later went on to Empire where she took up massage and skin care. In 2012 she launched her skin care line "Sans Défaut". Later that year she proceeded to launch her own nail polish brand which varied in colors and shades. Monteria opened Teri's Nail Bar in January of 2013.</h3></p>

	<p><h3>Sans Défaut is a natural organic based cosmetic line Monteria opened in 2012. Her goal was to make aging look flawless for the women who had aged differently than others. By the product being organic based, it was healthy enough to use on a daily and replenish the skin inside and out. The creamy texture of the liquid foundation mineralizes the natural skin and adds a legacy glow. This is what sparked the conversations about Sans Défaut. Women of all ages quickly adapted to the makeup line therefore placing Sans Défaut on the market<h3/></p>

	<p><h3>Monteria launched her nail polish line Rose De Mai in 2012 a few months after launching her makeup line. "When I was growing up, I would get tired of seeing the same colors over and over again. I thought to myself, If I could design my own polish, I would know what colors I like. So I did", stated Monteria in her interview in Vibe Magazines. Colors vary from Mink Pink to Industrial Blue. There is also a special mixture placed in the polish to help grow the natural nail. The polish includes a chip free base coat and last up to a month of nail shine. </h3></p>
